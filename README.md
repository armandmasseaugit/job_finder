# Job Finder â€” Automated Job Search and Ranking

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to automatically search for new job postings that match specific keywords 
(such as "data", "AI", etc.) across multiple websites. Each day, the system emails me summarizing 
the latest relevant job offers. These job listings are also displayed on a Streamlit web app.

On the web app, users can browse the latest offers and provide feedback by liking or disliking each job. 
This feedback is used to train a reinforcement learning model that ranks future offers by relevance. 
Users can then sort the listings based on these relevance scores to see the most personalized opportunities first.


## Features

- Automated web scraping of multiple job platforms for targeted keywords.
- Daily email notifications with summarized relevant job offers.
- Interactive Streamlit app for browsing, liking, and disliking job offers.
- Reinforcement learning model that learns user preferences to rank offers.
- Storage and versioning of data and models on AWS S3.

## Technology Stack

- **Python 3.8+**
- **Kedro**: for building reproducible and modular data pipelines.
- **Pandas, NumPy**: data manipulation and processing.
- **scikit-learn**: for machine learning (SGDClassifier, TF-IDF vectorization).
- **Streamlit**: web app frontend.
- **AWS S3**: storage of scraped data, models, and results.
- **Email service**: to send daily summaries (SMTP or any email API).
- **Optional**: Docker for containerized deployment.
